Warbot is an educational game aiming to teach multi-agent systems while introducing younger people to programming.  
The game itself is a simple RTS-type game where the goal is to destroy your opponent's base. The main difference being that instead of managing your army during the game, you pre-program your units' behaviour via an FSM defined in a simple, Scratch-like language.

MUSIC :
Heaven Sings written and produced by Ove Melaa (Omsofware@hotmail.com). Some parts where removed to loop better ingame.
